### Project Overview
This Customer segmentation project aims to generate insights into sales performance of the E commerce project over the past years. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance fromn our data.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is LITA Capstone Dataset.xslx and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning,
  2. For For Data Analysis and
  3. For Data Visualization

- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- GitHub for Portfolio Building [Download Here](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of bthe Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

Explorative Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
- What is the overall customer segmentation?
- Which region has the most sales?
- Which seller has the most revenue?
- Whaich products are on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
