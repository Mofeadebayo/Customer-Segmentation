### Project Overview
This Customer segmentation project aims to generate insights into sales performance of the E commerce project over the past years. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance fromn our data.
